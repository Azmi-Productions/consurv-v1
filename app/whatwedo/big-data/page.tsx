      "Predictive Maintenance aims to develop a versatile predictive model applicable across equipment and platforms. The approach focuses on analyzing existing data rather than implementing new sensors, ensuring efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Emphasizing value, even from small data sets, it aims to enhance processes continuously. Objectives include reducing downtime, maximizing production, optimizing inventory, and promoting cost-saving practices. Data acquisition is facilitated through the proprietary PI System. By leveraging predictive analytics, this methodology enhances equipment reliability, minimizes unplanned downtime, and streamlines maintenance operations, ultimately driving operational efficiency and improving asset performance.

          In the realm of Big Data, crafting robust enterprise data architecture
          is key. With expertise honed through collaborations with industry
          giants like SHELL, PETRONAS (RAPID), and multinationals such as IBM,
          Lenovo, and Intel, we specialize in blueprinting and implementing data
          architecture roadmaps. Consurv excels in extracting and cleansing vast
          datasets, leveraging technologies like Hadoop and partnering with
          industry-leading Data Warehouses. Our Data Scientists and Subject
          Matter Experts (SMEs) develop cutting-edge algorithms for predictive
          maintenance, supply-chain optimization, and gas production
          enhancement. With a track record of managing Petabytes of data, we
          transform raw data into actionable insights, driving innovation and
          efficiency.
