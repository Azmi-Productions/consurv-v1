      "First and foremost I would like to express my gratitude to DynaConsurv for accepting me as part of company. Thank you to Mr. Faiz for giving me an opportunity to learn and be familiar with industry before my real future working environment. Thank you to all staff to support and helping me in order to sustain the company objectives.",

      "During the interview session, Mr Faiz clearly mentioned ‘’Consurv Technic is just a small company but you definitely you will learn a lot.” As for me, I am more interested on how much I will learn through out 7 months of internship rather than how big your host company is. Honestly, I prefer small company to pursue my internship because of the working environment and the workload. Maybe some students like to become a part of multinational company but most of them complained because the top management put them only in small discussion and tasks due to confidential and lack of confidences in them.",
